    "persona_match": "Mike, an athlete familiar with 'The Zone,' relates to the need for mental clarity and blocking out distractions before a performance. The visual of intense focus mirrors the pre-workout or pre-race mindset.",
    "strategic_reason": "Positioning the headphones as a tool for 'mental focus' rather than just music appeals to the performance-driven mindset. The ad placement leverages the fox's moment of concentration to sell the benefit of zoning out the world.",

    "persona_match": "Mike is a 'Quantified Self' enthusiast who likely tracks his runs and biometrics. The concept of using invisible data (magnetic fields) to optimize physical movement and trajectory aligns perfectly with his interest in GPS watches and performance tracking.",
    "strategic_reason": "Triggering the ad exactly when the 'trajectory' and 'calculation' logic is explained positions the Garmin watch as the ultimate tool for plotting one's own course and tracking performance metrics in the wild.",
