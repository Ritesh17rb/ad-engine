    "persona_match": "This scene directly aligns with David's interest in 'Home Renovation' and his 'Practical' mood. While the Apple ad is about technology, its theme of 'Innovation' and revolutionizing the ordinary can resonate with a practical, value-seeking individual looking for new and efficient solutions, whether for tools or systems, in his renovation projects.",
    "strategic_reason": "Placing the Apple '1984' ad during a hands-on workshop scene connects to David's practical and home renovation interests. The ad's message of introducing a groundbreaking, innovative 'tool' (the Macintosh) can be seen as offering long-term value and efficiency, appealing to his 'Value Seeker' buying pattern in the context of improving methods and tools for practical tasks.",
